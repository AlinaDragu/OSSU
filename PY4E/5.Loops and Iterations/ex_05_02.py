# Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'. Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers. 
# If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the number.
# Enter 7, 2, bob, 10, and 4 and match the output below.
