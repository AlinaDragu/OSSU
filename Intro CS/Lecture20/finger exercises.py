# In this problem, you will implement two classes according to the specification below: 
# one Container class and one Queue class (a subclass of Container).   
  
# Our Container class will initialize an empty list. 
# The two methods we will have are to calculate the size of the list and to add an element. 
# The second method will be inherited by the subclass. 
# We now want to create a subclass so that we can add more functionality â€“ the ability to remove elements from the list. 
# A Queue will add elements to the list in the same way, but will behave differently when removing an element.
