#### Part A: Saving for a House
# You have just graduated from MIT and have a job! You move to the Bay Area and decide that you want to start saving for a home. Houses are fairly
# expensive, so you start saving up for the down payment on your dream home.
# Your goal is to find the number of months it takes to save up for a down payment. The cost of your down payment is calculated by multiplying the
# total cost of your dream house by the down payment percentage.

# User Inputs. Ask the user to enter the following variables and cast them as floats. They must be initialized in the following order at the beginning of
# your program, before declaring other variables.
# 1. The starting yearly salary ( yearly_salary)
# 2. The portion of salary to be saved ( portion_saved). This variable should be in decimal form (e.g. 0.1 for 10%).
# 3. The cost of your dream home ( cost_of_dream_home)

# Writing the Program. You will need to determine how many months it will take given the following information:
# 1. yearly_salary, as described above.
# 2. portion_saved, as described above.
# 3. cost_of_dream_home, as described above.
# 4. portion_down_payment, the percentage of the total cost needed for a down payment. Assume portion_down_payment = 0.25 (25%).
# 5. The amount that you have saved thus far is amount_saved, which starts at $0.
# 6. You get an annual rate of return r. In other words, at the end of each month, you receive an additional amount_saved * (r/12) funds for your
# savings (the 12 is because r is an annual rate). Assume r = 0.05 (5%).
# 7. At the end of each month, your savings increase by (1) a percentage of your monthly salary and (2) the monthly return on your investment. (Note:
# The investment amount used to calculate the monthly return is the amount you had saved at the start of each month.)

# Output.
# 1. Your program should store the number of months required to save for the down payment using a variable called months.






















#### Part B: Saving with a raise
# In Part A, we assumed that your salary did not change over time. However, you are an MIT graduate, and clearly you are going to be worth more to your
# company over time! In this part, we will build on your solution to Part A by adding a salary raise every six months. Copy over your solution from Part A
# into the corresponding sections in ps1b.py.

# User Inputs. There is one additional user input in Part B. Remember to cast these inputs as floats and in the following order before declaring other
# variables.
# 1. The starting yearly salary ( yearly_salary)
# 2. The portion of salary to be saved ( portion_saved)
# 3. The cost of your dream home ( cost_of_dream_home)
# 4. The semi-annual salary raise ( semi_annual_raise), which is a decimal percentage (e.g. 0.1 for 10%)

# Writing the Program. Write a program to calculate how many months it will take for you to save up for a down payment. You can reuse much of the
# code from Part A. Like before, assume that your investments earn an annual rate of return r = 0.05 (or 5%) and that portion_down_payment =
# 0.25 (or 25%). In this version, yearly_salary increases by semi_annual_raise at the end of every six months.

# Output.
# 1. Like Part A, your program should store the number of months required to save up for your down payment using a variable called months.
